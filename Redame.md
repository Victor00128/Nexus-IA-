# ProyectoV2

Hey! This is my second attempt at building a web project (hence the "V2" in the name lol). I'm still learning but pretty happy with how this turned out.

## What is this?

Honestly, I started this project to practice React and see if I could build something that actually looks decent. It's a simple web app but I tried to make it look professional. Still has some rough edges but I'm working on it!

## Tech stuff I used

- React (still getting the hang of hooks)
- CSS with some Tailwind thrown in
- Deployed on Vercel because it's free and easy
- Probably too many console.log statements that I forgot to remove 😅

## How to run it

If you want to mess around with this:

```bash
# Clone it
git clone [your-repo-url]

# Install stuff (this might take a while)
npm install

# Run it
npm start
```

Then go to localhost:3000 or whatever port it tells you.

## Current status

✅ Basic functionality works  
✅ Doesn't crash (most of the time)  
✅ Looks okay on mobile  
⚠️ Could use better error handling  
❌ Tests? What tests? (I know, I know...)  

## Live version

You can check it out here: https://vercel.com/julios-projects-58cdd9a8/v0-proyecto-v2

Fair warning - I'm still tweaking things so it might look different by the time you visit.

## What I learned

- React state management is tricky but powerful
- CSS Grid > Flexbox (fight me)
- Vercel deployments are actually magic
- I should probably learn TypeScript next
- Documentation is important (writing this README was harder than the actual code)

## TODO

- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Write some tests (eventually...)
- [ ] Clean up the CSS mess
- [ ] Maybe add a dark mode?
- [ ] Figure out why the mobile nav is weird sometimes

## Issues?

If something's broken, feel free to open an issue. I can't promise I'll fix it quickly but I'll definitely take a look!

## Thanks

Shoutout to Stack Overflow for basically teaching me React, and to my rubber duck for listening to all my debugging sessions.
